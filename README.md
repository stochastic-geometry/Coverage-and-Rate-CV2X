# Matlab code for the computation of coverage probability and rate coverage of a C-V2X network modeled by a Cox process driven by Poisson line process
---
This repository contains the matlab scripts used to generate the results of the paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09236.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09236.pdf) presented in Section-V. 


Run 'main.m' to compute coverage probability/rate coverage through Monte Carlo simulation of the network. 

Run main_thy.m to evaluate coverage probability/rate coverage using the theoretical expressions derived in the paper.
